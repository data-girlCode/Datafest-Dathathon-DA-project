Business Requirement 4: Comprehensive Risk Analysis
Combining all data sets, can you craft a comprehensive risk profile for our farming operations? This should identify potential threats to our yield, profitability, or resources over the next decade.

Step 1: Identify potential risks.
Examples of potential risks to farming operations may include;

•	Weather conditions: Extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves can damage crops and reduce yields.
•	Pests and diseases: Pests and diseases can damage crops and reduce yields.
•	Market volatility: Market volatility can lead to fluctuations in crop prices, which can impact profitability.
•	Supply chain disruptions: Supply chain disruptions can make it difficult to obtain essential inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides.
•	Labor shortages: Labor shortages can make it difficult to find and retain workers, which can impact productivity and costs.
